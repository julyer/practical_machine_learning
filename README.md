# Practical Machine Learning Course Project

This is the final project for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course from Johns Hopkins.

This project creates a model to try to correctly classify how subjects performed a particular exercise taken from data collected from sensors the subjects were wearing as they performed the exercise. The data comes from the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset which is part of the Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises by Velloso et al. The study involves 6 participants performing one set of 10 bicep curl repetitions in 5 different ways. The model attempts to identify from the various sensor readings which of the 5 ways the participant has performed the exercise.
